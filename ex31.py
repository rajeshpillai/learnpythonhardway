# Exercise 32: Loops and Lists
# You should now be able to do some programs that are much more interesting. If you have been keeping up, you should realize that now you can combine all the other things you have learned with if-statements and boolean expressions to make your programs do smart things.

# However, programs also need to do repetitive things very quickly. We are going to use a for-loop in this exercise to build and print various lists. When you do the exercise, you will start to figure out what they are. I won't tell you right now. You have to figure it out.

# Before you can use a for-loop, you need a way to store the results of loops somewhere. The best way to do this is with lists. Lists are exactly what their name says: a container of things that are organized in order from first to last. It's not complicated; you just have to learn a new syntax. First, there's how you make lists:

# hairs = ['brown', 'blond', 'red']
# eyes = ['brown', 'blue', 'green']
# weights = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# You start the list with the [ (left bracket) which "opens" the list. Then you put each item you want in the list separated by commas, similar to function arguments. Lastly, end the list with a ] (right bracket) to indicate that it's over. Python then takes this list and all its contents and assigns them to the variable.
