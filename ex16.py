# Exercise 16: Reading and Writing Files
# If you did the Study Drills from the last exercise you should have seen all 
# sorts of commands (methods/functions) you can give to files. Here's the list 
# of commands I want you to remember:

# close -- Closes the file. Like File->Save.. in your editor.
# read -- Reads the contents of the file. You can assign the result to a variable.
# readline -- Reads just one line of a text file.
# truncate -- Empties the file. Watch out if you care about the file.
# write('stuff') -- Writes "stuff" to the file.
# For now these are the important commands you need to know. Some of them take 
# parameters, but we do not really care about that. You only need to remember that 
# write takes a parameter of a string you want to write to the file.

# Let's use some of this to make a simple little text editor:


from sys import argv

script, filename = argv

print "We're going to erase %r." % filename
print "If you don't want that, hit CTRL-C (^C)."
print "If you do want that, hit RETURN."

raw_input("?")

print "Opening the file..."
target = open(filename, 'w')

print "Truncating the file.  Goodbye!"
target.truncate()

print "Now I'm going to as you for three lines."

line1 = raw_input("line 1: ")
line2 = raw_input("line 2: ")
line3 = raw_input("line 3: ")

print "I'm going to write these to the file."

target.write(line1)
target.write("\n")
target.write(line2)
target.write("\n")
target.write(line3)
target.write("\n")

print "And finally, we close it."
target.close()
