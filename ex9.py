# Exercise 9: Printing, Printing, Printing
# By now you should realize the pattern for this book is to use more than one 
# exercise to teach you something new. I start with code that you might not 
# understand, then more exercises explain the concept. If you don't understand something now, 
# you will later as you complete more exercises. Write down what you don't understand, and keep going.
