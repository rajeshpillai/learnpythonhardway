# Exercise 29: What If
# Here is the next script of Python you will enter, 
# which introduces you to the if-statement. Type this in, make it run exactly right, and then we'll see if your practice has paid off.

people = 20
cats = 30
dogs = 15

if people < cats:
	print "Too many cats! The world is doomed!"

if people > cats:
	print "Not many cats! The world is doomed anyway!"

if people < dogs:
	print "The world is drooled on!"

if people < dogs:
	print "The world is dry!"

dogs += 5

if people >= dogs:
	print "People are greater than or equal to dogs."

if people <= dogs:
	print "People are less than or equal to dogs."

if people == dogs:
	print "People are dogs."
